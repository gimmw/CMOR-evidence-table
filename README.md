# CMOR-evidence-table
Interactive evidence table and preference weights for OA interventions

### About
This application provides access to evidence tables for osteoarthritis interventions used in the project The impact and management of rising osteoarthritis burden (Prof Haxby Abbott, Centre for Musculoskeletal Outcomes Research, University of Otago).

Interventions for the clinical management of knee osteoarthritis are characterised according to eight attributes (recommendation, quality of evidence, cost, duration of effect, accessibility, risk of mild/moderate harm, risk of serious harm, and effectiveness), informed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' Clinical Practice Guidelines for osteoarthritis.

Interventions are ranked by assigning 'preference weights', derived from key stakeholder groups (consumers/OA patients, MƒÅori health advocates, health care providers, health policy makers, and content area experts), to each attribute, which are then summed to derive an aggregate preference score and ranking for each intervention.

The online application, available at [https://cmor.shinyapps.io/cmor-evidence-table/](cmor.shinyapps.io/cmor-evidence-table/ "CMOR Evidence Table - shinyapps.io"), allows users to select the disease stage and source of evidence to inform the evidence table, select the interventions to be included, vary the preference weights assigned to each dimension, and view the output in table and graphical form.
